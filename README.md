# Data-Science-Projects
This Repo contains solved data science projects:

## 1. Iris Data Set
iris_dataset_scatterplot-svgThis is probably the most versatile, easy and resourceful dataset in pattern recognition literature. Nothing could be simpler than the Iris dataset to learn classification techniques. If you are totally new to data science, this is your start line. The data has only 150 rows & 4 columns.
### Problem: Predict the class of the flower based on available attributes.

## 2. Loan Prediction Dataset
ssAmong all industries, the insurance domain has one of the largest uses of analytics & data science methods. This dataset provides you a taste of working on data sets from insurance companies – what challenges are faced there, what strategies are used, which variables influence the outcome, etc. This is a classification problem. The data has 615 rows and 13 columns.

### Problem: Predict if a loan will get approved or not.

## 3. Bigmart Sales Data Set

Retail is another industry which extensively uses analytics to optimize business processes. Tasks like product placement, inventory management, customized offers, product bundling, etc. are being smartly handled using data science techniques. As the name suggests, this data comprises of transaction records of a sales store. This is a regression problem. The data has 8523 rows of 12 variables.

### Problem: Predict the sales of a store.

## 4. Boston Housing

This is another popular dataset used in pattern recognition literature. The data set comes from the real estate industry in Boston (US). This is a regression problem. The data has 506 rows and 14 columns. Thus, it’s a fairly small data set where you can attempt any technique without worrying about your laptop’s memory being overused. 
### Problem: Predict the median value of owner occupied homes.

## 5. Human Activity Recognition
Human activity recognition, or HAR, is a challenging time series classification task.
<br><br>
It involves predicting the movement of a person based on sensor data and traditionally involves deep domain expertise and methods from signal processing to correctly engineer features from the raw data in order to fit a machine learning model.
<br><br>
Recently, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks have shown capable and even achieve state-of-the-art results by automatically learning features from the raw sensor data. In this notebook we will build a Convolution neural network using the TensorFlow library.
### Problem : Predict the type of activity
